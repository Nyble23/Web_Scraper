This folder contains sample output that will be generated on executed the code.
We get two output files :
1. A text file containing URLs of the review pages
2. A csv file that contains the scrapped data in desired format.

The sample files are generated by using the search item as "tshirt".
The CSV output has been truncated to only reviews of two or three items with all their variants, i.e., 60 entries, for easy readability of the generated output.
